<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Filter (Less Comfortable)" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/less/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I implemented a program that applies image filters (grayscale, sepia, reflection, and blur) to a BMP image. The program reads an image file, applies the selected filter, and writes the modified image to a new file.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy. For additional clarification, you can refer to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>
Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input</strong>: The program takes an input BMP file and applies the selected filter.</li> <li><strong>Image Manipulation</strong>: The program supports four filters: <ul> <li>Grayscale</li> <li>Sepia</li> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Blur</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: The filtered image is written to a new BMP file.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Grayscale</strong>: Converts the image to grayscale by averaging the RGB values of each pixel and applying that average to all color channels.</li> <li><strong>Sepia</strong>: Converts the image to sepia by applying a formula that adjusts each RGB value to create a warm, brownish tone.</li> <li><strong>Reflection</strong>: Reflects the image horizontally by swapping pixels across the vertical axis.</li> <li><strong>Blur</strong>: Applies a box blur by averaging the color values of each pixel with its neighboring pixels.</li> <li><strong>File Handling</strong>: The program reads and writes BMP files, ensuring the correct format and structure is maintained.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as the BMP images or the Makefile.</p>
